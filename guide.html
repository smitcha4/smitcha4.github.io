        My name is Tallahassee Colombus. I am a retired professional sport fisherman and 
        a working angler guide. I have fished in 156 tournaments, won 32 tournaments, placed 
        3rd in a BASS Angler of the Year title tournament. I have over 20 years of angler guide
        experience and specialize in all varieties black and temperate bass. Lake Grapevine is
        a great place in North Texas to capitalize on largemouth, smallmouth and white bass. 
        Whether you are a beginner or intermediate angler I can help teach and hone your tactics.
        What is most important to me is that you have a good time and enjoy your experience
        in the great outdoors. Individuals or groups of ten people or fewer are welcome. I have 
        over 20 different fishing rods to choose from and multiple shorter rod and reel combos for 
        the kids if this is a family trip. Please feel free to send your email below and I will
        get in touch with you as soon as possible to schedule a trip!
